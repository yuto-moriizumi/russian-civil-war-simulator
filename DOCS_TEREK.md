# Terek Soviet Republic - Initial Setup Documentation

## Historical Context
The Terek Soviet Republic was established in March 1918, but for the purpose of the simulator starting in November 1917, it represents the Bolshevik and pro-Soviet forces in the Terek Oblast (North Caucasus).

## Initial Territories
The following regions should be assigned to `terek`:
- `RU-CE` (Chechnya) - ShapeID: `28173009B98838729156012`
- `RU-IN` (Ingushetia) - ShapeID: `28173009B75413689166101`
- `RU-SE` (North Ossetia–Alania) - ShapeID: `28173009B7235812138525`
- `RU-KB` (Kabardino-Balkaria) - ShapeID: `28173009B46612801043871`

## Diplomatic Relationships
- **War**: `white` (Volunteer Army/White Army)
- **War**: `don` (Don Republic - generally hostile to Soviet entities)
- **Neutral/Hostile**: Local nationalist/Islamist forces (if represented)

## Suggested Starting Units
The Terek Soviet Republic relied on local Red Guard detachments and radicalized soldiers returning from the Caucasian front.
- 2-3 Red Guard Divisions in Vladikavkaz (`RU-SE`)
- 1-2 Red Guard Divisions in Grozny (`RU-CE`)

## AI Behavior
The country should focus on defending the North Caucasus and potentially expanding towards Stavropol or Astrakhan to link up with Soviet Russia.
